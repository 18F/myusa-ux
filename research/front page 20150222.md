# Quick summary
Please see raw notes as [comments on InVision project](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/2318574/62062701/comments). This summary is just for the purposes of closing out the issue. 

## Split into audiences makes sense
"The way that’s broken down into the audience for agencies and developers [makes sense]. I think that those two audience groups are going to be doing very different tasks." - Joanne

## Central image/text is visually appealing but not informative
"It’s a big banner, it’s a pretty picture. But now I have to hunt to find something that’s my task. Because my task — is my task to Connect to MyUSA, right? Is there a task?" - Joanne

## Next section seems like a footer

"I almost feel like this should be footer information because it doesn't offer more information. Are there more partners? Is it just these three? I don't really know." - Sarah

## Offerings to agencies are unclear

### Simple and Private for whom?
"Is it really for the agencies or is it simple and private for the user? I would think that would be more for the public. Trying to reconcile MyUSA for agencies with Simple and Private. That icon — I didn’t understand how that worked. I would probably put Ease of Access." - Jonathan

### What are those tools?

"It kinda sounds like they have an online tool or service to facilitate that process of getting assistance from GSA to build other services within our own agency" - Sarah 
"It's for APIs, right?" - M.

## Developers want more information before signing up

"I don't like the fact that I have to sign up for something. Why can't I just explore? It's like I have to make a commitment. Why can't I just browse for more information." - M

### Words that seem to be misleading throughout the page
