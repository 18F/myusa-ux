# Current sign-on practices

## Managing account data is hard work
![graphic describing differences between PIV card model and Google sign-on.](https://github.com/18F/myusa-ux/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-02%20at%201.59.38%20PM.png)
PIV cards are attached a person; people using them feel like there is no intermediary between them and the site they're trying to access. Google OAuth makes it clear that the user is going through a third-party

Despite those tools, many online services still require **unique user accounts**.

Each account has different associated usernames and passwords. 

> All participants had more than 10 different accounts to manage. Two had more than 20. 

Passwords do not have standard requirements, and they must be changed regularly

So government employees create **personal workarounds**

>“If I left the paper at the office I wouldn’t have it available. And also because you have to change the passwords every few months it was easier to have something you can update in realtime.”
>Participant 4, GSA
>Stores usernames and password hints in Google Docs spreadsheet 

>Every participant interviewed had a different workaround

**Email was the preferred tool.**
>Half of the participants used email to keep track of government account information.

**Individual workarounds vary in security**
+ Password-protected thumbdrive with account info in plaintext on Word doc
+ Website names saved as contacts in address book, and usernames and passwords stored as fields
+ Usernames and passwords saved as hints in Excel spreadsheet and Word doc
+ Account info written down in paper notebook, kept by desk in secured office
+ Usernames and passwords stored in drafts in email

>“My travel app requires five separate pieces of information. What else do they expect me to do?”

# Reactions to federated identity schemes
While government employees want single sign-on, they have qualms about commercial providers
 
### Are government employees interested in using a single sign-on across government websites? #497 
The short answer: yes (given that we interviewed six people). 

However, there was *intense wariness about the single sign on options presented
+ Google
+ Verizon
+ Paypal
+ ID.me

In general, mistrust of commercial provider's motivations colored responses: 

![what we are saying does not match what participants are hearing. We say "Allow Paypal to verify 
your identity so that you can use this government service" and they hear: "Share information about your finances with the government"](https://github.com/18F/myusa-ux/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-02%20at%202.45.58%20PM.png?raw=true)

### How do government employees react to signing in with companies that are associated with a specific business function (such as Verizon or Paypal)? #522 

Reactions were not positive, including: 

+ Uncertainty
> I don’t know who’s taking the information and using it.
> Participant 1, HHS

+ Distrust
> Why would the government be sending personal information on its employees to [Google] for advertising purposes?
> Participant 2, HHS
(Note that no such exchange of information is happening or was

### How do government employees react to signing in using social network logins (e.g. Google)? #521 

While reactions were less negative than those to the more specialized providers (e.g. Paypal), a few federal employee participants -- especially those who already used Google for work -- were concerned about mixing work and home life information. 

> I just like to keep work and personal life separate
> Participant 3, HHS, who didn't want to use the same account to sign into work services and personal services
