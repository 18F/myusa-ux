# Background
A [first round of research](https://github.com/18F/myusa-ux/blob/master/research/front%20page%2020150222.md) found that what MyUSA offers to agencies is unclear
- Top image/text is visually appealing but not informative
- Developers needed more specific information before signing up
- Words like "connect" and "service" were easily misread
- Benefits to agencies were unclear

After the last round of research @mkhandekar has revised the landing page and designed two directions for the Learn More page directed at federal employees in partner agencies. 

# Goals and Questions
| Goals | Questions to answer | Metrics |
|:------|:-------|:---------| 
| Select one Learn More direction to develop further.|Which Learn More makes what we offer agencies clearer?| 1. Participants can accurately explain what MyUSA does <p> 2. Participants can explain why _an agency_ (if not _their_ agency) might employ MyUSA for sign-in <p> They do _not_ need to be able to explain how MyUSA works|
| Evaluate the changes to the landing page | Have we resolved the issues with the old one? | 1. Participants can find the Learn More page that applies to the agency role <p> 2. Participants click on the Learn More link _without being prompted to do so_ <p> That is, does the page interest participants enough to click around, and can they find the appropriate resource for them? |

# What we're doing
We'll do about 6 remote interviews with federal employees who match the profile of our agency partner contacts, having them visit a lightly interactive Invision mockup of the landing page and Learn More page. 

Then we'll do a group analysis of the results on mural.ly, with the outcomes being...
