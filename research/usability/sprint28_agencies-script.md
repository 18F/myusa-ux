## Introductions


_Does the participant have any questions?_

What we're going to do today is called a talk-aloud activity -- you say what you're thinking as you examine the page. 

What you're going to see is an interactive mockup -- more like a PDF than a real webpage. Some links will work, and some won't. 

_Paste Invision link into video conferencing_
