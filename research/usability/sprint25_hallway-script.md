# Testing sign-in flow

MyUSA is a service we are currently designing to streamline the process of signing in to government websites. 

We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. 

As an example of how MyUSA works, we are using Benefeds, which is a website GSA employees use to enroll for benefits.
