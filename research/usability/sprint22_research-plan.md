# Account management screens research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate account management screens | Can people edit their profile data?
 | Can they figure out which applications they have authorized?
 | Can they delete an account?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?

## Background
We haven't done any testing of the account creation side of MyUSA.

### Metrics

* Whether problems prevent any of the participants from completing the tasks

## Methods
* 45 min interview with 18F-ers who are unfamiliar with the MyUSA web interface
* Notes, no recording
* Remote or in-person
* Includes retrospective design crit

*TBD: Do we use the live site or a lightly interactive InVision clickthrough? That will change the script a bit.*

*TBD: Should we test account creation, too?*

## Script

### Make a new account for Midas [TBD, probably]
**Scenario** You're going to make a new account for Open Opportunities so that you can get people to help 18F.

**Now please sign in** 

#### Interpreting sign-in choices

1. Which CSP do they pick. Why?
2. 2FA?

#### Email transition

1. Do they have problems transitioning to email?
2. Do they have problems returning back 

#### How do they interpret the permissions screen?

1. What does this screen mean to you?
2. What would you do if you wanted Open Opportunities to know your first name but not your last?

**Okay, now we're back at Open Opportunities. Now I'm going to ask you to take a look at your MyUSA profile.**

[How does someone get to their MyUSA profile? Through a link in the Midas profile?]

### Edit profile data
**Please change your first name so that it's a little less formal**

1. Can they navigate to the profile screen?
2. Can they figure out that they can change the name?

### Add a phone number for 2FA
**You know that 2FA is important. But you accidentally added the wrong phone number. Please change your 2FA phone number**

1. Can they find 2FA under "Settings"?
2. How do they feel about having 2FA settings next to Delete settings?

## Workshop 
**Okay, having gone through the two main functions of this service, how might you improve...**

1. Sign-in?
2. Account management?
