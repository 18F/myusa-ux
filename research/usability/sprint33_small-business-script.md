# Conversation guide

## Preparation

- [ ] *A couple days ahead of time,* figure out how you're doing to gain informed consent from the participant. There are a few options. For people inside the government, you can use this Google form: http://goo.gl/forms/36drKMoKDL. That doesn't always work for the public.  
 
- [ ] *Right before the interview,* start a Liveshare on the correct page. Then email that link to the interviewee during the interview. This is a painful hack but it's what we've got. Other screensharing tools are often blocked for federal employees. I will happily take suggestions for a better way.

## Major activities
1. Discuss their relationship with federal government sign on
2. Watch them walk through our sign-in

## Introduction

Hi there. Thanks for meeting with me. 

### About this study

As the email said, we're interested in improving how small businesses interact with the federal government. 

### Get consent

We're having this conversation so that other people can learn from it, and so that we make a product that is really taking in consideration what potential users need. I want to be sure that I understand and respect your wishes for how I should treat what you tell me.

#### If you sent a consent form and received one back 
Thanks for the consent form! Just to review, here's what you told me (_insert the options they chose here_). 

#### If you sent the form and they forgot to deal with it
Email them the Google shortlink above

#### If they could not open the form and they are federal employees

It's probably okay to read them this verbal consent. It's always better to get a written consent, but troubleshooting various security configurations on the fly is not the best use of their time. 

1. I'd like to take notes (and share with my immediate team) :arrow_right: _If you want to audio or video ask about these too_ Is that okay with you?

2. Is it okay if I share some quotes from those notes in a report that would be visible to the public? We will not use your name. 

It is fine to answer to no to either or both of those questions. During the interview, you don't have to answer any of my questions, and it's fine to take a break or end the interview at any time. If you tell me anything that you want to keep private and you realize it at the end of the interview or even after we're done, just tell me and I'll delete it. 

#### If they could not open the form and they are members of the public

:explosion: Liz has a PDF that she will link here which should do the job. 

_Check whether the participant has any questions or concerns about the consent_

## Relationship with federal websites and signing in

### About your business

:arrow_right: Knowledge goals: Learn what the participant's business does and what s/he does there.

### Relationships with government

:arrow_right: Knowledge goals: Learn how often participant logs into government websites, which ones s/he principally visits,  and the purpose of the visits. Follow-up on how the most recent ones progressed.

_Phrase questions to fit the context of the participant's business and role. You'll probably ask slightly different questions, in a different order, each time._

## Evaluating the sign-in flow

Let's move on to looking at a service we're currently developing. 

MyUSA is an application we are currently designing to streamline the process of signing in to government websites.

To give you an example of MyUSA works, we are using BusinessUSA, which is a website that rounds up resources provided by the federal government to help small businesses. 

We're going to do today is called a talk-aloud activity -- I'd like to go through the pages and verbally describe what you're seeing, doing, and thinking. 

We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. You will likely click on things that don't work. That's ok. We'll tell you if that happens. 

_Ask them to go to Invision liveshare link and sign in. Let them know that it might take a moment to load_ 

Here's a general scenario. So, let's say you've come to BusinessUSA looking for financing opportunities. You find a page -- this page --  with the access financing wizard -- that will help you find relevant opportunities for your business. 

:arrow_right: Knowledge goals: Describe their expectations for what each screen does, how it works, and what they would do next to accomplish their goals. Identify where their expectations have been violated (if at all), and why. Check whether they have any unanswered questions about what the service does and how it works. 

_Watch what each individual participant does and improvise specific questions based on what you observe._

_Depending on the circumstance, you might ask: "What would you do after {describe their previous action}?" or "What did you expect to happen when the {name page here} loaded?" or "Why did you say {repeat their words}?"_ 

### Screens to test
#### front page of sample site
#### Choose how to log in? 
#### Enter email 
_Clarify that this is Liz's email, not the participant's_
#### Almost there
_Observe whether participant clicks the Ok close button_
#### Email
#### Permissions 
:arrow_right: Knowledge goals for permissions page: Observe how they navigate the toggles and help text buttons. Probe more fully on any concerns about data sharing, particularly of PII.  

_Prompt participants to use help text or click toggles if they do not do so on their own. Each person will navigate this differently, follow them._

Now I'm going to ask you to do a few things for me. 

##### Task 1: Tell me why we're asking for your email.

[If they don't see the why button, you can spend a little time on letting them guess. _Then_ ask them to click the button and see what they say.] 

##### Task 2: Share your name with BusinessUSA.

[They can either click toggle or try to type in a name -- both are success states]

##### Task 3: Tell MyUSA that you live in CA.

[Success state: finding a specific line and clicking okay]

##### Task 4: Now do the same for being a veteran. 

#### Complete
##### Task 5: Now finish the login. 

## Conclusion

:arrow_right: Knowledge goals: Make sure the participant has (a) said everything s/he wanted to say and (b) knows that you will delete anything from the notes at his/her request. 

Thanks so much for your time.
