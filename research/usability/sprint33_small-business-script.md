# Script

## Pre-interview prep

Right before the interview, start a Liveshare on the correct page. Then email that link to the interviewee. This is a painful hack but it's what we've got. 

## Activities
1. Relationship with federal government sign on
2. Walk through our sign-in

## Introduction

_Does the participant have any questions about the consent?_


## Relationship with government sign-in

### Frequency
1. Have you logged into a government website in the past year?
2. How many times? 
3. Which ones?

### Transactions with gov't

1. What was your last interaction?

## Sign-in flow

MyUSA is a service we are currently designing to streamline the process of signing in to government websites. 

As an example of how MyUSA works, we are using BusinessUSA, which is a website that rounds up resources provided by the federal government to help small businesses. 

What we're going to do today is called a talk-aloud activity -- you say what you're thinking as you examine the page. 

We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. 

_Ask them to go to Invision liveshare link and sign in_

Anything else you want to say? Anything I should have asked about?
