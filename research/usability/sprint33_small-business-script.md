# Script

## Pre-interview prep

Right before the interview, start a Liveshare on the correct page. Then email that link to the interviewee during the interview. This is a painful hack but it's what we've got. I will happily take suggestions for a better way. 

## Major activities
1. Relationship with federal government sign on
2. Walk through our sign-in

## Introduction

Hi there. Thanks for meeting with me. 

### About this study

As the email said, we're interested in improving how small businesses interact with the federal government. 

### Get consent

So, we are having this conversation so that other people can learn from it. I want to be sure that I understand and respect your wishes for how I should treat what you tell me.

1) I'd like to take notes. Is that okay with you?
2) 

_Does the participant have any questions about the consent?_

## Relationship with government sign-in

### About your business

What does your business do?

What's your job there? 

### Frequency
Have you logged into a government website in the past year?

How many times? 

Which ones?

### Transactions with gov't

What was your last online interaction with the federal government? (if any)

How did it go? What started it? 

Is that typical, in your experience? 

## Sign-in flow

Let's move on to looking at a service we're currently developing. 

MyUSA is an application we are currently designing to streamline the process of signing in to government websites.

As an example of how MyUSA works, we are using BusinessUSA, which is a website that rounds up resources provided by the federal government to help small businesses. 

What we're going to do today is called a talk-aloud activity -- you say what you're thinking as you examine the page. 

We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. 

_Ask them to go to Invision liveshare link and sign in_  

### Front page of sample site

So, let's pretend you've come to BusinessUSA looking for financing opportunities. You find a feature -- the access financing wizard -- that will help you find relevant opportunities for your business. 

What would you do next? 

[If s/he wouldn't log in, ask them to log in]

### Choose how to log in? 

What would you do next?

How would you choose to log in? 

[If not MyUSA, then ask to try out MyUSA]

What would you expect to happen if you did that? 

### Enter email

So this is _Liz's_ email, not yours but you get the point...

What would you do next? 

### Almost there

What would you do next? 

Why? 

[See if s/he clicks the button.]

### Email

What would you do next?

### Permissions 

What's your first reaction? 

Is this what you expected?

Do you have any questions? 

Now I'm going to ask you to do a few things for me. 

#### Task 1: Tell me why we're asking for your email.

[If they don't see the why button, you can spend a little time on letting them guess. _Then_ ask them to click the button and see what they say.] 

#### Task 2: Let's say you wanted to send your name. How would you do that? 

Would you share your name? 

Why or why not?

[See if they can find the toggle and what they think about entering the name changing the toggle]

[They can either click toggle or try to type in a name -- both are success states]

#### Task 3: State

Pretend you live in CA and tell MyUSA that you live there.

[Finding a specific line and clicking okay]

How do you feel about doing that? 

#### Task 4: Now do the same for being a veteran. 

How'd that go? 

#### Complete

So, okay, what would you do to finish up and log in?


## Conclusion

Anything else you want to say? Anything I should have asked about? 

Thanks so much for your time.
