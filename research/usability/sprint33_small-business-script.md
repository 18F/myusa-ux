# Script

## Pre-interview prep

Right before the interview, start a Liveshare on the correct page. Then email that link to the interviewee. This is a painful hack but it's what we've got. 

## Activities
1. Relationship with federal government sign on
2. Walk through our sign-in

## Introduction

_Does the participant have any questions about the consent?_


## Relationship with government sign-in

### Frequency
1. Have you logged into a government website in the past year?
2. How many times? 
3. Which ones?

### Transactions with gov't

1. What was your last interaction?
2. How did it go? What started it? 
3. Is that typical, in your experience? 

## Sign-in flow

MyUSA is a service we are currently designing to streamline the process of signing in to government websites. 

As an example of how MyUSA works, we are using BusinessUSA, which is a website that rounds up resources provided by the federal government to help small businesses. 

What we're going to do today is called a talk-aloud activity -- you say what you're thinking as you examine the page. 

We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. 

_Ask them to go to Invision liveshare link and sign in_  

### Front page of sample site

What would you do next? 

### Choose how to log in?

Is this what you expected?

What's your first reaction? 

Do you have any questions? 

#### Task 1: Why?

Tell me why we're asking for your email.

What do you think of that? 

Tell me why we're asking for your name.

#### Task 2: Name

Would you share your name? 

Give it a shot -- what would you do to share your name?

[See if they can find the toggle and what they think about entering the name changing the toggle]

[They can either click toggle or add name -- both are success states]

#### Task 3: Veteran

As you can see, there are a bunch of lines here.

Take a look at them.

Pretend you're a {veteran, live in CA, have a specific zipcode) and tell MyUSA that you are. 

[Finding a specific line and clicking okay]

How do you feel about doing that? 

#### Complete

So, okay, what would you do to finish up and log in?


## Conclusion

Anything else you want to say? Anything I should have asked about?
