# Background
We now have clearance to do hallway testing at the San Francisco Federal Building (aka SFFB). I want to take advantage of this opportunity and do a round for Sprint 25. This also will give us a chance to road-test @mkhandekar's major revisions of the permissons screen before showing them to small business people.

Earlier research with the permissions screens surfaced two main issues:
* Participants didn't notice that they could control what they shared
* Participants didn't notice that they could edit the information they were sharing
* Much of the text was confusing

# Goals and hypotheses

Goals | Hypotheses
------------ | -------------
Pick a direction for the permissions page | Making the reason for requesting the data more visible will increase trust in the system 
|  
Test whether we've fixed email copy problems | One link is less confusing than two links

# What are we going to do?
This is a comparative evaluation of reactions to three different permissions screen pages. We are evaluating:

1. Whether making the _reason_ the application is requesting the data more visually prominent increases trust in the system
2. Whether a toggle selector vs a checkbox to turn sharing off and on helps users practically control
