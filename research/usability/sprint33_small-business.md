# Background
MyUSA has a number of potential integrators serving small business owners. We haven't done any research with small business owners, nor have we done much research with potential users who are not on the coasts. The research we have done research is internal (18F, other parts of GSA, and HHS). This study will focus on small business owners across the US, aiming for 6-9 participants (most likely remote, but potentially some in-person). It will help us identify and triage problems before ATO. 

# Goals and questions

We know that small business owners and employees may well be using MyUSA soon. This activity will:

1. give us more insight into how small businesses are currently managing interations with government services
2. check whether our findings from secondary research and research with federal employees are relevant to other groups
3. evaluate redesigned sign-in flow in time for Julia to make minor changes

| Goal | Question | Metrics |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|
| Identify current frustrations with signing in to government websites | How are people managing on-going transactions with government agencies? <br/> - making accounts and signing in <br/>- returning to an ongoing activity after a break| |
| | What tools are they using? Workarounds?| |
| | How interested are potential users in a shared sign-on service? | |
| Assess attitudes towards data sharing | What concerns do people express about signing in with MyUSA? |
| | |
| | How do US users who are **not** government employees react to signing in using sites that offer many services (e.g. Google)?|
|Evaluate redesigned sign-in flow| Are we scaffolding practical consent?|Most participants notice the permissions| 
| | |Most participants can edit permissions when asked|
| | |Most participants notice the permissions| 
| | |Participants notice the why button and can restate the info it accesses in their own words|
| | |Participants can explain the choices they would make, demonstrating accurate knowledge of the likely results|

## Intended outcomes
* Immediate fixes for sign-in flow

# What are we going to do?
## Find participants 
### Desired profile
Aiming for maximum variety in region and business type, but trying to focus on sole proprietors of new businesses, since we are informed that these make up the majority of US small businesses. 
### Recruiting
  * up to 9 participants
  * not in DC, NYC, or SF
  * through friends and family
    * right now: SF (1), Tucson (3), Chicago (1) 
  * through posts to social media
  * [Blurb](https://github.com/18F/myusa/issues/596#issuecomment-95762044)
