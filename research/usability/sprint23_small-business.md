# Background
It looks like MyUSA has a number of potential integrators who serve small business owners. We haven't done any research with small business owners, nor have we done much research with potential users who are not on the coasts. This study will focus on small business owners across the US, aiming for 6-9 participants (most likely remote, but potentially some in-person). 

# Methods
Locations are tbd. We will be looking for maximum variety in region and business type, but trying to focus on sole proprietors of new businesses, since we are informed that these make up the majority of US small businesses.
