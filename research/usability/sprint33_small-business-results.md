# Background
MyUSA has a number of potential integrators serving small business owners. We hadn't done any research with small business owners, nor had we done much research with potential users who are not on the coasts. At the same time, we wanted to check out our new sign-in flow one more time before launch. 

# Goals

1. Give us more insight into how small businesses are currently managing interations with government services
2. Check whether our findings from secondary research and research with federal employees are relevant to other groups
3. Evaluate redesigned sign-in flow 

# Participant profile
Four people who work for, own, or invest in small businesses in Tucson (3), Chicago (1), and San Francisco (1). All worked in IT, even if their main business was not tech-related. Two had significant experience with federal government procurement. 


| Goal | Question | Metrics |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|
| Identify current frustrations with signing in to government websites | How are people managing on-going transactions with government agencies? <br/> - making accounts and signing in <br/>- returning to an ongoing activity after a break| |
| | What tools are they using? Workarounds?| |
| | How interested are potential users in a shared sign-on service? | |
|Evaluate redesigned sign-in flow| Are we scaffolding practical consent?|Most participants notice the permissions| 
| | |Most participants can edit permissions when asked|
| | |Most participants notice the permissions| 
| | |Participants notice the why button and can restate the info it accesses in their own words|
| | |Participants can explain the choices they would make, demonstrating accurate knowledge of the likely results|
| |Are we doing a good job at earning trust?|What concerns do participants express about signing in with MyUSA?|
| |Have we successfully put personal data in context of relationships?|Particularly, what about business vs non-business relationships?|
| |Have we lowered the barriers to sign in enough?|The long list of permissions might be daunting. How do participants react to it?|
| | |How do participants feel about the multiple sign in steps?|

# Limitations and caveats

This is fewer participants than I would prefer, and too many of them are IT experts to be representative of the US small business population. Treat these findings as provisional. 

However, the results broadly match those of previous studies carried out with larger participant numbers from different backgrounds, so I have a bit more confidence in them than I usually would
