# Summary
We asked four owners/employees of small businesses to talk about their job-related interactions with the federal government, then had them walk through a [clickable mockup](http://invis.io/SP3JX23ET) of the MyUSA sign-in flow. 

## Sign in flow largely usable after the first few screens
#### Initial screens do not accurately communicate MyUSA interactions, leading to misapprehensions later on
We need to better communicate that: 

:arrow_right: that the email *is* the sign-in identifier, so that clicking the access link is the act of signing-in

:arrow_right: the benefits of access-link sign-in 

:arrow_right: that MyUSA is separate from the integrator (although it is understood to be an official US service)

#### No problems with transitions to and from email
#### Minor tweaks to permissions screen could speed completion
* Participants had no problems editing permissions
* Privacy-sensitive and privacy-defensive participants appreciated the help text
* Convenience-oriented participants sought shortcuts
* Large toggles may visually distract from attention to what we're asking for
```
Toggles are large and bold, my eyes gravitate towards them. So I didn't see the intro text.

33-P04
```
#### New theme: why is any information optional?
For convenience-optimizers, any optional information should be hidden behind a secondary call to action
For privacy-defenders, it's not clear why we'd ask for _any_ information we don't 

## Other findings echo secondary research and our other studies of the sign-in flow with federal employees 
* Widespread misapprehensions about how federated identity provision works
* Mistrust of commercial IdPs is commmon 

# About the study
MyUSA has a number of potential integrators serving small business owners. We hadn't done any research with small business owners, nor had we done much research with potential users who are not on the coasts. At the same time, we wanted to check out our new sign-in flow one more time before launch. 

## Goals
1. Learn more about how small businesses are currently managing interations with government services
2. Check our findings from secondary research and research with federal employees against other groups
3. Evaluate redesigned sign-in flow in time to affect build-out

## Participant profile
Four people who work for, own, or invest in small businesses in Tucson (3), Chicago (1), and San Francisco (1). All worked in IT, even if their main business was not tech-related. Two had significant experience with federal government procurement. 

## Limitations and caveats
This study had fewer participants than the 6 researchers usually aim for, and too many of the participants are IT experts to be representative of the US small business population. Take the results as provisional. 

However, the results broadly match those of previous studies carried out with participants from different backgrounds, so I have a bit more confidence in them than I usually would.
