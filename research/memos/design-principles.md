# [Earn people's trust](#trust)

There is widespread mistrust of the entities that collect and share personal data, from commercial sites to the government. 

This has some follow-ons: 

1. Don't assume that first-time visitors believe that MyUSA is a government service
2. Don't assume that users will believe the best of our intentions
3. Engage visitors gradually. Ask for only the information that is needed, when it is needed. 

# [Put personal data in context of relationships](#context)

People have lots of different roles in life: at work, with family, in a circle of friends, among various communities and social groups. Some people don't mind if these different roles are unified under a single identifier. Other people really like to keep those different roles separate. 

This is why people use different emails for work and for home. Or different phones. 

If people want to keep different relationships to the US government (e.g. taxpayer, loan applicant, job applicant, et cetera) separate _don't force a single identifier on them unless it's absolutely necessary. 

# [Make consent meaningful](#consent)

MyUSA needs to get its users consent before sharing their personal data with relying parties. What is meaningful consent? 

1. informed: based on information presented in a way that makes sense to consenter
2. effective: that is, consent that can alter the outcome of the interaction
3. free: consent that is not extracted

# [Act like a means to an end](#block)
People encounter MyUSA while they're trying to get something else done, such as post on a forum or bookmark a document. MyUSA, as a sign-on system, is inevitably a hurdle standing between a person and what s/he wants to get done. 

This has two main follow-ons

1. Don't slow people down unnecessarily
2. Show progress in relationship to the end goal
