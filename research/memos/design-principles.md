# [Earn people's trust](#trust)

There is widespread mistrust of the entities that collect and share personal data, from commercial sites to the government. 

1. Don't assume that first-time visitors believe that MyUSA is a government service
2. Don't assume that users will believe the best of our intentions
3. Engage visitors gradually. Ask for only the information that is needed, when it is needed. 

# [Put personal data in context of relationships](#context)

People have lots of different roles in life: at work, with family, in a circle of friends, among various communities and social groups. Some people don't mind if these different roles are unified under a single identifier. Other people really like to keep those different roles separate. 

This is why people use different emails for work and for home. Or different phones. 

1. _Don't make people unify different identity contexts under a single identifier_ unless it's absolutely necessary. 
2. Frame requests for data in context of how we're going to use it. Do we need a street address for mailing purposes or for asserting residency?


# [Make consent meaningful](#consent)

MyUSA needs to get its users consent before sharing their personal data with relying parties. What is meaningful consent? 

1. Informed: based on information presented in a way that makes sense to consenter
2. Effective: that is, consent that can alter the outcome of the interaction
3. Free: not extracted or coerced

# [Be a gateway, not a barrier](#block)
People encounter MyUSA while they're trying to get something else done, such as post on a forum or bookmark a document. MyUSA, as a sign-on system, is inevitably a hurdle standing between a person and what s/he wants to get done. We want to keep the hurdle low and easy to leap over.

This has three main follow-ons

1. Don't slow people down unless it's necessary to another principle.
2. Always show progress towards achieving the end goal
3. Keep people moving towards their end goal, even if it means sending them away from MyUSA.
