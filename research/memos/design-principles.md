# Trust must be earned

There is widespread mistrust of the entities that collect and share personal data, from commercial sites to the government. 

Don't assume that first-time visitors believe that MyUSA is a government service

Don't assume that users will believe the best of our intentions

Engage visitors gradually. Ask for only the information that is needed, when it is needed. 

# Don't merge what people want separate

People have lots of different roles in life: at work, with family, in a circle of friends, among various communities and social groups. Some people don't mind if these different roles are unified under a single identifier. Other people really like to keep those different roles separate. 

This is why people use different emails for work and for home. Or different phones. 

If people want to separate different relationships to the US government by role (e.g. taxpayer, loan applicant, job applicant, et cetera) _don't force a single identifier on them unless it's absolutely necessary. 

# Make consent meaningful

MyUSA needs to get its users consent before sharing their personal data with relying parties. What is meaningful consent? 

1. informed consent: based on information presented in a way that makes sense to consenter
2. effective consent: that is, consent that can alter the outcome of the interaction
3. free consent: consent that is not extracted

# We are a means to an end
People encounter MyUSA while they're trying to get something else done, such as post on a forum or bookmark a document. MyUSA, as a sign-on system, is inevitably a hurdle standing between a person and what s/he wants to get done. 

So let's not slow people down too much.

Always provide users of MyUSA with a clear way to accomplish their goals.
