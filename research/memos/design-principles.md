# [Earn people's trust](#trust)

There is widespread mistrust of the entities that collect and share personal data, from commercial sites to the government. 

1. Don't assume that first-time visitors believe that MyUSA is a government service
2. Don't assume that users will believe the best of our intentions
3. Engage visitors gradually. Ask for only the information that is needed, when it is needed. 

# [Don't undermine boundaries](#context)

People may have different roles in life: at work, with family, in a circle of friends, among various communities and social groups. Some people like a central place to manage all those roles. Other people want them to stay separate. Moreover, data that is accurate in one world (such as preferred mailing address) may not make sense in another.  

# [Make consent meaningful](#consent)

MyUSA needs to get its users consent before sharing their personal data with relying parties. What is meaningful consent? 

1. Informed: based on information presented in a way that makes sense to consenter
2. Effective: that is, consent that can alter the outcome of the interaction
3. Free: not extracted or coerced

# [Be a gateway, not a barrier](#block)
People encounter MyUSA while they're trying to get something else done, such as post on a forum or bookmark a document. MyUSA, as a sign-on system, is inevitably a hurdle standing between a person and what s/he wants to get done. We want to keep the hurdle low and easy to leap over.

1. Be careful when interactions slow down decision-making.
2. Show progress towards the end goal.
3. Keep people moving towards their end goal, even if it means sending them away from MyUSA.
