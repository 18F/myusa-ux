I want to start thinking about different ways that people approach the data-sharing controls in MyUSA.

## Important variables
### **action orientation** 
action <---> analysis

How likely is someone to read help text before clicking a button?

### **boundary sensitivity** 
worried  <---> unconcerned

How concerned is someone about data leakage across social and organizational boundaries?

## Behavioral tendencies

|&nbsp;|Action | Analysis |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|
|**Worried**| _Privacy defensive_ <br> "I didn't know what this was so I clicked cancel" | _Privacy anxious_ <br> "I find this help text reassuring" |
|**Unconcerned**| _Convenience optimizing_ <br> "Whatever. I'll just click allow" | _Authority deferential_ <br> "I wondered about those checkboxes, but this is for my job, right?"|
