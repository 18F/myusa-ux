I want to start thinking about different ways that people approach the data-sharing controls in MyUSA.

## Important variables
### **action orientation** action <---> analysis
How likely is someone to read help text before clicking a button?

### **boundary sensitivity** worried  <---> unconcerned
How concerned is someone about data leakage across social and organizational boundaries?

## Behavioral tendencies
### Privacy defensive
### Convenience optimizing
### Authority respectful

 |Action | Analysis
 |:------- | :-------
 **Worried**  | "I didn't know what this was so I clicked cancel" | "I find this help text reassuring" 
 **Unconcerned** | "Whatever. I just click allow" | "I wondered about those checkboxes, but this is for my job, right?"
